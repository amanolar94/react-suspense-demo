# React Suspense Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), forked from [this](https://github.com/yomete/react-suspense-demo) repository and altered to consume [this](https://hn.algolia.com/api) and [this](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) hackernews API.

It uses the Alpha version of React 16 (16.4.0-alpha.0911da3) so as to experiment with React Suspense.

You can view the demo [here](https://react-suspense-demo-hackernewsapi.netlify.com/) and read the accompanying article at [LogRocket's Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/async-rendering-in-react-with-suspense-5d0eaac886c8) that demostrates how to build the forked demo.
